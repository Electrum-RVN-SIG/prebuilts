Syncing headers is an important part in verifying that what the electrum servers are telling you is true. If you have the time, I highly recommend that you just let your client sync on its own. It shouldn't take more than a few hours for the initial syncing.

However, If for what ever reason you are low on time and you trust me enough...

Step 1) Download and extract the "blockchain_headers" file.
Step 2) Move that file to your Electrum-Ravencoin folder. (Most likely ~/.electrum-ravencoin)
Step 3) Start electrum ravencoin.
Step 4) Profit.
